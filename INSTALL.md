To build the project

- `dune build`

Packages we are using: 

- `ounit2`: This was used extensively throughout 3110, so it should be installed
- `str`: Comes apart of the OCaml basic library
- `ANSITerminal`: Terminal that we will be using for the demo of the project. This was a package already installed for A2.

    - `opam install ANSITerminal`

To start the game: 
    
- `make play`

    - `opam install ANSITerminal`
